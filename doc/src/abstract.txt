Cloud computing has proven to be a successful distributed computing
model as demostrated by its wide spread industrial adoption. Apart
from public Clouds, such as Amazon EC2, private and hybrid Cloud
deployments are important for organizations of all scales. The
availability of free open source Cloud platforms is essential to
further drive the proliferation of private and hybrid Cloud computing
environments. OpenStack is free open source Cloud computing software
originally released by Rackspace and NASA, which strives to close the
gap in the lack of a comprehensive Cloud platform with a fast pace of
development and innovation, and supported by both an active community
of people and large companies. In this work, we go through and discuss
the steps required to come from bare hardware to a fully operational
multi-node OpenStack installation. Every step discussed in this paper
is implemented as a separate shell script making it easy to understand
the intricate details of the installation process. The full set of
installation scripts is reseased under the Apache 2.0 License and is
publicly available online.
